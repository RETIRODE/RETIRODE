## Real Time range depiction

The objective of the team project is to develop firmware application running on RSL10 SoC (BLE MCU) and interfacing with ON Semiconductor Direct Time of Flight rangefinder SECO-RANGEFINDER-GEVK. RSL10 will further transmit the distance data over BLE channel towards mobile app (Android, iOS), visualizing the interior.BLE will work in connected mode and the BLE mother board to be used in the system is BDK-GEVK.BDK-GEVK and SECO-RANGEFINDER-GEVK are attached to a rotating platform that allows 2D / 3D scanning of surrounded area. Platform rotation will be constructed using the stepper motors and actuator kit D-STPR-GEVK.
